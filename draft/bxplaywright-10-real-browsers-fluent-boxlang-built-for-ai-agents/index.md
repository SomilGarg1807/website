**Ortus Solutions today announces the general availability of [bx-playwright 1.0](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io), fluent browser automation and testing for BoxLang, powered by Microsoft Playwright. It ships alongside [TestBox 7.2](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/readme/release-history/whats-new-with-7.2.0) and [ColdBox 8.3](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/release-history/whats-new-with-8.3.0), which bring real-browser testing straight into your specs. Drive Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, test full user journeys, render PDFs and images, and give your AI agents a real browser to verify the BoxLang applications they build.**

```js
playwright().browse( ( page ) => {
	page.visit( "/login" )
		.fill( "Email", "luis@ortus.com" )
		.fill( "Password", "secret" )
		.click( "Sign in" )
		.assertPathIs( "/dashboard" )
		.assertSee( "Welcome back" )
		.screenshot( "dashboard.png" )
} )
```

That's a full login check. It reads like the steps you'd write on a sticky note, and every line runs in a real browser. 🚀

```bash
install-bx-module bx-playwright
bxplaywright install
```

## The BoxLang productivity stack just got eyes 👀

BoxLang is the software productivity platform for building, modernizing and running applications, with developers and AI agents working together. We've been assembling the pieces that make agents productive on BoxLang:

- **[BoxLang AI](https://ai.boxlang.io)** for models, agents, tools and memory
- **Live MCP documentation servers** so agents read current docs instead of guessing
- **[Skills](https://skills.boxlang.io)** that teach agents how BoxLang and every framework in the stack actually work
- **Machine-readable compiler feedback** with `boxlang check --format json`, so agents can fix their own errors

That covers *writing* code. But an agent that writes a login page and never opens it hasn't finished the job. It has guessed. The missing piece was letting the agent, and your test suite, open the app, click through it like a user, and prove it works.

That is bx-playwright. It closes the loop: **build, run, browse, assert, fix.** Native to BoxLang, on the JVM, with no JavaScript test project bolted on the side. And with TestBox 7.2 and ColdBox 8.3, that browser lives right inside the tests you already write.

## Why bx-playwright

- **Fluent and chainable.** Every action returns the page, so a whole user journey is one readable expression.
- **Smart selectors.** Target what users see. `"Sign in"` finds the button, `"Email"` finds the field by its label. Need precision? Use `@name` for `data-testid`, plain CSS, Playwright syntax, or AI snapshot refs like `ref=e12`.
- **No flaky waits.** Assertions retry until they pass or time out (5 seconds by default), so you never sprinkle `sleep()` calls through your tests.
- **Profiles for everything.** `playwright( "mobile" )`, `playwright( [ "android", "dark" ] )`, `playwright( "ci" )`. Dozens of built-in browser, screen, device, appearance and mode presets, merged left to right, plus your own.
- **No Node project to manage.** Install it like any other BoxLang module. The installer fetches the driver, Node.js and browsers for you, or grab `bx-playwright-full` with Node.js bundled for every platform, ready for air-gapped servers.
- **Built for agents from day one.** Token-efficient snapshots, ready-made tools for BoxLang AI, an MCP server, inline API help, structured errors and official Agent Skills. More on that below.
- **Free and open source.** Apache 2.0, everything included.

## What's in the box 📦

- **[Browsing](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/browsing/):** navigation, clicks, typing, forms, uploads, drag and drop, frames, popups and downloads, scoping with `within()`, plus locators with `count()`, `texts()`, `nth()` and `filter()`
- **[Assertions](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/assertions/):** inline `assertSee()`, `assertPathIs()`, `assertVisible()` and friends, or expect-style matchers like `toHaveText` and `toBeVisible`. Wrap checks in `page.soft()` to collect every failure at once
- **[Network and APIs](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/network/):** intercept, mock, block or modify requests, listen to console and network traffic, test HTTP APIs directly, and reuse logged-in sessions
- **[Quality checks](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/quality/):** visual regression with diff images, built-in WCAG accessibility audits, `assertNoConsoleErrors()` and `assertNoSmoke()` smoke tests across a list of URLs
- **[Page objects, components and macros](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/page-objects/):** model screens as `PageObject` classes and reusable widgets as `PageComponent` classes, or extend the API with your own macros
- **[Rendering](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/rendering/):** screenshots, PDFs and rendered HTML from a real browser engine, including the `bx:playwrightRender` component
- **[Automation scripts](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/automation/):** browser jobs as `.bxs` scripts, scheduled with cron or a BoxLang scheduler
- **[Web applications](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/web-applications/):** use it from a running BoxLang server, with `playwrightEnsureBrowser()` to provision browsers from server code
- **[CLI](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/cli/):** `install`, `doctor`, `codegen`, `screenshot`, `pdf`, `show-trace`, `mcp` and more, with bash completions and `--json` output
- **[Building on bx-playwright](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/integrations/):** a documented public contract under semantic versioning, plus interception events like `onPageCreate` and `onPlaywrightArtifact` for frameworks and libraries

A few tastes:

```js
// Mock an API and block images
page.intercept( "**/api/users" ).respondJson( [ "Luis", "Brad" ] )
page.intercept( "**/*.{png,jpg}" ).abort()

// Visual regression, masking the parts that change
page.assertScreenshotMatches( "dashboard", { fullPage : true, mask : [ "@clock" ] } )

// Accessibility audit
page.assertNoAccessibilityIssues( { exclude : [ "color-contrast" ], impact : "moderate" } )
```

And rendering with a modern browser engine, straight from a template:

```html
<bx:playwrightRender type="pdf" path="invoice.pdf" format="A4" margin="1cm">
	<h1>Invoice #invoice.id#</h1>
</bx:playwrightRender>
```

## Browser testing, built into TestBox 7.2 and ColdBox 8.3 ✅

Three releases ship together, and the browser is the thread. We'll cover TestBox and ColdBox in depth in their own posts, so here is a taste.

Add `@browser` to any TestBox spec and you get `browse()`, isolated pages per spec, and retrying browser matchers. ColdBox 8.3 brings the same to `BaseTestCase`, with named route helpers like `visitRoute()` and `assertRouteIs()` and saved-session logins.

```js
@browser
@baseURL( "http://localhost:8080" )
class extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec" {

	function run() {
		describe( "Login", () => {
			it( "signs in", () => {
				browse( ( page ) => {
					page.visit( "/login" )
						.fill( "Email", "luis@ortus.com" )
						.fill( "Password", "secret" )
						.click( "Sign in" )
					expect( page ).toHavePath( "/dashboard" )
				} )
			} )
		} )
	}

}
```

Failures bring their own evidence: screenshots, traces and videos attach to the spec. Watch it in action:

When a browser test fails, you see exactly why:

{{< youtube id="6EGVLIlCFiQ" >}}

And in ColdBox, your browser specs know your application:

{{< youtube id="wCEOUPFxbHo" >}}

There is more where that came from: nine browser matchers, multi-user flows, spec retries, rerun only what failed, `--web-server` to start your app with your tests, and more. Dig into the [TestBox Browser Testing guide](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com/browser-testing/browser-testing) and the [ColdBox Browser Testing guide](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/the-basics/testing-quick-start/browser-testing) today.

> Browser specs are BoxLang classes and need the bx-playwright module. On BoxLang without it they are skipped with an install hint.

## Built for AI agents 🤖

This is where bx-playwright stops being "a testing library" and becomes core infrastructure for AI-assisted development on BoxLang.

### Snapshots agents can actually read

Screenshots are expensive for a model and raw HTML is noisy. bx-playwright gives agents a compact accessibility tree where every interactive element gets a reference:

```js
println( page.snapshot( options = { mode : "ai" } ) )
// - textbox "Email" [ref=e5]
// - button "Sign in" [ref=e7]

page.fill( "ref=e5", "luis@ortus.com" ).click( "ref=e7" )
```

The agent sees the page the way a screen reader does, picks a ref, and acts on exactly that element. Fewer tokens, no guessing at selectors.

### A browser as a toolset for BoxLang AI

One call turns a Playwright instance into tools any [BoxLang AI](https://ai.boxlang.io) agent can use:

```js
agent = aiAgent(
	name         : "Browser",
	instructions : "Use the browser tools to complete the task.",
	tools        : playwright( { baseURL : "http://localhost:8080" } ).aiTools()
)

agent.run( "Log in as luis@ortus.com and tell me how many todos I have" )
```

The agent gets `browser_visit`, `browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`, `browser_select`, `browser_press`, `browser_back`, `browser_text`, `browser_screenshot` and `browser_close`. Every tool returns the updated page state, and errors come back as text instead of exceptions, so the agent can read what went wrong and recover on its own. Using another agent framework? `aiToolDefinitions()` returns the same tools as plain definitions.

> `aiTools()` uses BoxLang AI, so install it alongside: `install-bx-module bx-ai`

### Playwright MCP for your coding agent

Working in Claude, Cursor, VS Code or another MCP client? One command serves a browser:

```bash
bxplaywright mcp --headless

# Claude Code
claude mcp add playwright -- bxplaywright mcp --headless
```

Add `--port 8931` to share one server over HTTP. Your coding agent can now drive a browser against the BoxLang app it's building, right from your editor.

### Agent Skills and docs your agent can load

Seven official skills teach your agent browsing, assertions, network, rendering, testing, setup and AI integration:

```bash
npx skills add ortus-boxlang/skills/boxlang-modules/bx-playwright
```

Browse them, plus the TestBox and ColdBox browser testing skills, on [skills.boxlang.io](https://skills.boxlang.io/skills?search=playwright). The full docs are also available as [llms.txt](https://bxplaywright.boxlang.io/llms.txt).

### Feedback agents understand

- **Inline API help:** `page.help()`, `page.help( "fill" )` and `playwright().help()` document the API at runtime, so agents look it up instead of hallucinating methods.
- **Structured errors:** every failure has a `type`, `message` and `detail` with resolution guidance. `Playwright.Timeout` tells you to check the selector with `page.snapshot()`. `Playwright.NotInstalled` tells you to run `bxplaywright doctor`.
- **Machine-readable CLI:** `--json` on CLI commands returns structured output and errors, and `bxplaywright help --json` describes every command.

### And for the humans: codegen

Click through your app and get BoxLang code back:

```bash
bxplaywright codegen http://localhost:8080 --output=login.bxs
```

## Coming soon: BxAgents

bx-playwright is also a core component of **[BxAgents](https://bxagents.ai)**, our upcoming conventions-based AI agent framework built on ColdBox and BoxLang AI. That means agents built with BxAgents get a real browser to verify their work, out of the box. We'll have much more to share very soon. 👀

## Coming from cbPlaywright?

On BoxLang? bx-playwright is the way forward.

## Get started

**Requirements:** BoxLang 1.17+ and Java 21+. For browser specs: TestBox 7.2+ and, for the route helpers, ColdBox 8.3+.

Two distributions:

- **`bx-playwright`** (~4 MB): uses Node.js 20+ on your machine, or downloads and verifies one for you
- **`bx-playwright-full`**: Node.js bundled for every platform. Useful for offline and restricted environments when browser artifacts are pre-provisioned in advance.
```bash
# Install the module
install-bx-module bx-playwright

# Install the driver, Node.js and Chromium, then verify
bxplaywright install
bxplaywright doctor

# Linux CI: include the system libraries
bxplaywright install chromium --with-deps
```

Your first script:

```js
// hello.bxs
playwright().browse( ( page ) => {
	page.visit( "https://boxlang.io" )
	println( page.title() )
	page.screenshot( "boxlang.png" )
} )
```

```bash
boxlang hello.bxs
```

Running on a CommandBox server? Install the module when the server is first set up:

```json
"onServerInitialInstall": "install bx-playwright --nosave"
```
